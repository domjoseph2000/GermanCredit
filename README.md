When a bank receives a loan application, based on the applicant’s profile the bank has to make a decision regarding whether to go ahead with the loan approval or not. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision;

- choosing the wrong customer who is less credit worthy,
- and rejecting the right customer who is high credit worthy.

If the applicant is a good credit risk, i.e. is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan to the person results in a loss of business to the bank If the applicant is a bad credit risk, i.e. is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan to the person results in a financial loss to the bank.

The German Credit Data contains data on 20 variables and the classification whether an applicant is considered a Good or a Bad credit risk for 1000 loan applicants.

This exercise is structured in the following format;

* Data Import and Initial Data Analysis: In this step we import the necessary packages, create the required functions custom to our needs for the purpose of data analysis, visualisation and modelling. We also do some basic checks like missing values, shape of data and remap some categorical values to standard format.

* Exploratory Data Analysis: Where we deep dive into each attribute individually to see if there are any peculiarities about them that needs to be understood and corrected if needed.

* Correlation/Association Analysis: Where we look at relationships among variables to see if there is high degree of correlation and association between any pair of variables.

* Perform Modelling Techniques: In this stage, we apply different modelling techniques on the data and produce output reports to compare which one performs the best.

* Conclusion
